PDFBOOK
=======

Description
-----------

Rearrange pages in a PDF file into signatures and (optionally) rescale
to fit 2 original pages on 1 physical one. Allows one to easily
convert pdf documents to booklet format, e.g. transform from A4 paper
to A5 pages on A4 paper, such that one can fold the pages and obtains
a small booklet.


Authors

Original version by Tigran Aivazian, based on the algorithm from
psutils/psbook.c, which was written by Angus J. C. Duggan 1991-1995.

On a *nix environment, installation should be as simple as running
'make pdfbook' in the directory containing the pdfbook.c source.

Runtime-depends on LaTeX and the pdfpages package and pdfinfo.


Usage
-----

Running pdfbook without parameters produces a short help.

For simply transforming an A4 document to print in A5 booklet format,
use: 'pdfbook -2 <infile> <outfile>'
